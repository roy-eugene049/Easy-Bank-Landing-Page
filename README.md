### Links

Live Site URL: [Vercel](https://easy-bank-landing-page-seven-rho.vercel.app/)

## My process

I think I did pretty well considering that I focus mainly on CSS styling

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- FlexBox
- Javascript
- Sass preprocessor

I said that I won't use any frameworks and build it from scratch to be more exciting and challenging

### What I learned

There's no right way to do it as long as your workflow works for you.

### Continued development
